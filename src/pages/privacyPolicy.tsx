                                such as your contact information provided as part of account registration. If your personal
                                information changes, you may correct, delete inaccuracies, or amend information by making the
                                change on our member information page or by contacting us through info@treint.com. We will
                                make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as
                                reasonably practicable. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, out of date or
                                incomplete (or becomes untrue, inaccurate, out of date or incomplete), or Treint has reasonable
                                grounds to suspect that the information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, out of date or
                                incomplete, Treint may, at its sole discretion, discontinue the provision of the Services to you.
                                There may be circumstances where Treint will not correct, delete or update your Personal Data,
                                including (a) where the Personal Data is opinion data that is kept solely for evaluative purpose;
                                and (b) the Personal Data is in documents related to a prosecution if all proceedings relating to
                                the prosecution have not been completed.</p>
                            <p>3.1.7. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to
                                provide you Services, contact us through info@treint.com. We will retain your information for as
                                long as your account with the Services is active and as needed to provide you the Services.</p>
                            <p>3.1.8. If you wish to opt-out of receiving non-essential communications such as promotional and
                                marketing-related information regarding the Services, please send us an email at
                                info@treint.com.</p>
                            <p>3.1.9. Treint may require the User to pay with a credit card, wire transfer, debit card or cheque
                                for Services for which subscription amount(s) is/are payable. Treint will collect such User’s credit
                                card number and/or other financial institution information such as bank account numbers and
                                will use that information for the billing and payment processes, including but not limited to the
                                use and disclosure of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary to
                                complete such billing operation. Verification of credit information, however, is accomplished
                                solely by the User through the authentication process. User’s credit-card/debit card details are
                                transacted upon secure sites of approved payment gateways which are digitally under
                                encryption, thereby providing the highest possible degree of care as per current technology.
                                However, Treint provides you an option not to save your payment details. User is advised,
                                however, that internet technology is not full proof safe and User should exercise discretion on
                                using the same.</p>
                            <p>3.1.10. Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User or the End-User or
                                anyone who visits the Website, Treint automatically receives the URL of the site from which
                                anyone visits.</p>
                            <p>3.1.11. The Website uses temporary cookies to store certain (that is not sensitive personal data
                                or information) that is used by Treint and its service providers for the technical administration of
                                the Website, research and development, and for User administration.</p>
                            <p>3.1.12. Treint does not exercise control over the sites displayed as search results or links from
                                within its Services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on the Users’
                                computer, collect data or solicit personal information from the Users, for which Treint is not
